	<h2>This website will be about different kinds of eyes! Yaah</h2>
    <h3>Alcoholic eyes are often bloodshot, twitching or dry. Some things you might experience are cataracts, double vision and loss of contrast.</h3>

    <h3>Dilated eyes, or mydriasis are often caused by adrenaline, head injuries, or neurological conditions. Sometimes, in the dark, our eyes dilate to let in more light.</h3>
